# MyBills

A simple bill tracking app for notifying due bills.

## About

I made this because, although apps like Mint are cool, they can, and are, pretty invasive. You can't be sure about what they're doing with your data.

So, I made this because I just wanted to be notified of monthly bills to mentally keep track of them without much effort.
